# Used when starts_with_prev_assign is true
# When you create a new assignment you will typically want to set STARTS_WITH_PREV_ASSIGN=true, NUMBER_CURRENT to the current assignment
# and NUMBER_PREV to the previous assignment.  This will setup pull requests between the previous assignment and current assignment
# in each student's github repository.  So assuming assignment 2 builds on assignment 1, assignment 2 will use NUMBER_CURRENT=2 AND
# NUMBER_PREV=1
NUMBER_PREV=1
# The name of the previous assignment, as set in github classroom.
# Used when starts_with_prev_assign is true (and used to find each student's repository related to the previous assignment)
